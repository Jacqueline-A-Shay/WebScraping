It covers the rest of the mid-sole and shields it from the potentially damaging nature of the surfaces. The forefoot section features a more responsive material called blown rubber. It delivers additional cushioning and lift, making each toe-off more enabled and energized.;","The Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17 has a standard running shoe length. It comes in sizes that adhere to the regular preferences of runners. There are a variety of width profiles: Narrow - B, Medium - D, Wide - 2E, Extra Wide - 4E for the men’s version. For the women’s version, it’s Narrow - 2A, Medium - B, Wide - D, Extra Wide - 2E.","The HPR Plus is a rubber compound that’s highly resistant to abrasion. It is capable of protecting the rest of the sole unit from the abrasive nature of the surfaces. It also delivers long-lasting and efficient traction. Blown Rubber is a compound that’s more responsive than shoe-standard rubber. It gives additional cushioning to the runner. Placed in the forefoot section, its job is to add a bit more responsive cushioning as the wearer gears up for the toe-off. The Stable Pod Configuration is the design of the mid-sole/outsole. It makes sure that the platform is shaped in a balanced and ergonomic way, therefore affording the runner a smooth and agreeable heel-to-toe transition. The Omni Grooves are small trenches in the sole unit, which allow the runner more flexibility. They make sure that natural foot-movement isn’t impeded or restricted.","The Element Mesh is a breathable fabric. It allows air to enter the foot-chamber in order to keep the foot cool and dry. It also manages moisture, preventing it from being absorbed by the interior fabric and padding. The mid-foot section of the upper features an Adjustable Saddle. It ensures a more comfortable and secure fit, while also preventing any wobbling of the foot. Synthetic Overlays have been stitched onto the main upper fabric. They make the overall coverage more secure because they adapt to the tightening or loosening of the shoelaces. The Element Lining is the material used for the interior sleeve of the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17. Like the Element Mesh, it also prevents moisture from being absorbed by the shoe, thus keeping the interior environment suitably dry and odor-free."

At the perimeter of the shoe are large and arrow-shaped lugs that face opposite directions. The design makes uphill or downhill moves easier to handle. Saucony uses this outsole configuration as this has a more forgiving compression, which aids slightly the cushioning and shock-absorbing abilities of the shoe.","The upper dictates the performance, feel, and fit of the Xodus ISO Runshield. As the Runshield technology is known for, the upper is coated with DWR material, which is extremely resistant to water. The lightweight support is made possible by the ISOFit construction of the mesh. These overlays are tied to the laces and greatly helps with the security and support in this shoe. Trail protection comes in the form of the Molded Toe Shell or a relatively thick rubberized material that prevents the toes from getting bruised. A gusseted design keeps the tongue in place and keeps debris from easily getting inside. Enhanced comfort is provided by the ComforLite Sockliner, which is also utilized for its anti-odor and anti-microbial properties. The Rundry lining around the ankle collar wicks moisture away and ramps up the step-in comfort."

Although the ISO fit has been used many times over by Saucony, the Freedom takes this upper technology to a new level. Instead of being two separate pieces of the upper that are attached to the upper, this ISO tech is now fully incorporated into the shoe, which gives a feeling of a shoe that offers support while at the same time moving very well with the foot with every stride.;Another huge feature in this shoe is Saucony’s use of the Everun tech as a full-length structure in the midsole, instead of being just beneath the sock liner or hedged in the heel area. The result is a ride that has experts running for the best superlatives. It offers a resilient response, unaffected by temp, extremely light, powerful, and smooth.;For even more dose of lightweight, responsive cushioning, an Everun topsole also sits just beneath the standard industry sockliner.;The outsole is yet another new feature in the shoe. Instead of a mix of carbon and blown rubber, what runs in the underfoot is mostly hard rubber. Saucony improves the traction by placing arrow-shaped lugs all over the outsole, called the Tri-Flex.;",The new ISO technology hugs the foot comfortably and securely. Runners can also get a sufficient space in the toe box to feel fast without being crushed. The heel also has excellent locked down hold. It generally runs true to size.,"Out of Saucony’s new bag of technologies is the new translucent outsole design called the Crystal Rubber. As the name suggests, the outsole lets the runner see basically the entire midsole, which is evident by the Everun name splashed across the midsole. This is made of firm carbon rubber as opposed to the hard and soft mixture of most shoes. The durability of the Freedom ISO is exceptional based on the rubber material and construction. For more traction, arrow-shaped lugs run from the heel to the forefoot. They are almost of the same size and depth as well.","The ISO tech is mostly integrated to the upper that creates a wraparound feel of comfort, support, and hold. To prevent the Freedom ISO from weighing too much, Saucony used little padding in many areas of the upper while seamless and ultra-light overlays are utilized for improved support and structure. A removable sockliner adds cushioning together with the Everun topsole."

The completely revamped upper is the first thing that catches the eye for those who are familiar with the Kanadia series. In this version, the upper uses a relatively thick side panel to improve the shoe’s upper durability and locked down support.;A new mesh is in the works as well. It has slightly larger holes for added breathability since the side panels cover most of the shoe’s upper. A very large heel loop makes shoe entry and exit more convenient.;Adidas introduces a new Cloudfoam in the midsole that is a bit softer than before. It gives the shoe a more forgiving ride without taking away any significant snap from the midsole.;The outsole gets a boost by virtue of bigger lugs, particularly around the perimeter of the Kanadia 8.

As the laces are cinched, the panel securely locks down the foot, which is great for stability and support when running on rugged terrains. The new mesh is a bit softer and also breathable. Adidas uses plush material around the ankle collar and the tongue for increased comfort. A molded sockliner enhances cushioning and support."

The lesser number of cords saves weight and gives the upper a more refined look.;The Flymesh also uses bigger forefoot holes for improved breathability. Nike boosts the endurance of the upper with a thicker lamination as eyelet support. In this version of the Flymesh, there is an improved mix of structure and flexibility in areas where the runner needs it.;Nike wanted a ride that is a bit smoother in the Structure 20 by removing the bump in the arch. While the medial post is still around, the now almost plain arch section moves heel strike to take-off a bit quicker.;Stability, though, is a touch better in this version as the tri-midsole foam is a hint firmer than the earlier model.

A soft blown rubber offers grip while the hard carbon rubber in the heel and midfoot provides long-lasting work.,"Nike brings back the Flymesh upper in the Structure 20.

In United States it's the #258 most popular running shoes.",56%,25%,13%,3%,0%,"Asics’ most advanced midsole technology in the FlyteFoam is clearly the biggest difference maker in this shoe. It brings more responsiveness without losing the stability and moderately-cushioned run that is a trademark of the DS Trainer series.;The outsole is another area where the Asics DS Trainer 22 gets a boost in performance. Most notable among the changes is the appearance of prominent star-like tread in the forefoot for a significant increase in grip despite the weather;A more subtle change in the outsole comes in the form of a slightly bigger and deeper Guidance Line that helps with the smoothness of the transition through the gait cycle and more flexibility.;Part of the reason why the latest model of the DS Trainer is very light is because of a more minimalist upper. There are lesser and thinner overlays that are well-positioned to give adequate midfoot hold, especially for those who over pronate a little.;Finally, better reflective details improve the safety precautions when running in low-visibility areas.;","The Asics DS Trainer 22 generally runs true to size, but a tad narrower in the toe box. For those who have slightly wider feet, getting a size up should be a sensible option. The midfoot has sufficient security while an external heel counter locks down the rear portion. As it has a more glove-like fit, the entire shoe moves very well with the foot.","The outsole design is very typical of Asics, except for the well-appreciated enhanced forefoot treading. It is actually an improvement over the past model as the Asics DS Trainer 22 offers a better grip, including areas after a rain. The AHAR+ rubber is a staple in the underfoot construction as it prolongs the life of the outsole. Running almost the full length of the outsole is a vertical cut that is also called the Guidance Line. The line makes the landing to toe-off movement efficient and smooth. A softer blown rubber, which is known in Asics lingo as DuraSponge, is utilized in the forefoot for more traction.","The very simply simple upper is largely a combination of very breathable open mesh with minimal bonded overlays around the midfoot. With the seamless construction in the upper, runners are assured of a friction-free run. Providing some semblance of security in the heel is a prominent heel counter. A healthy interior is made possible by a ComforDry Sockliner that has anti-microbial and anti-odor properties."

The forefoot is largely made of blown rubber for added traction. For that smooth transition, Puma uses a large cut from the heel to the forefoot, which it calls the Transition Line. It helps the runner move from the heel to the forefoot with less effort.","The seamless construction is mostly notable because of the very open, 2-layer mesh. Breathability is ensured by the large holes while support and structure are provided by a more supportive version next to the outer covering. The heel shows a heel loop for easy on or off maneuver.

New Balance offers the biggest change in the heart of the shoe-the midsole. In this model, the ABZORB foam finds its way into the shoe for a substantial upgrade in cushioning and shock-absorbing features. It gives the shoe a good balance between stability and cushioning.;Another change that is not readily visible is the heel offset. From 12mm of the past models, it is now down to 10mm. The change is aimed at reducing the slightly unstable feel of the earlier models because of the very substantial heel drop.;To counter the thick midsole, New Balance also made the flex grooves deeper and made the outsole very well-articulated in the 940 v3. These give the shoe added flexibility, enhance the cushioning, and adds a bit more to the shock-absorbing capacity of the shoe.;","The fit of the New Balance 940 v3 is generally the same as the earlier editions of this line.

The heel, the outer side of the shoe, and the tip of the forefoot are covered with Ndurance rubber, which is a very durable carbon rubber for a long-lasting performance. Giving the shoe more traction and a little more responsiveness is blown rubber in the forefoot and part of the midfoot.",A fairly simple upper is largely made of a very breathable mesh and synthetic overlays. The entire upper adds support and security to the foot. New Balance uses an Ortholite Sockliner for more cushioning and support. A traditional lace-up closure keeps the fit secure all throughout the run.

The company introduced their Duo Motion midsole which is made up of two EVA units that have different densities.;Most of the shoe’s underside durability is due to the Mapping Compound by Vibram. This material is sturdy, so it aims to handle different types of terrain. It also presents runners with adequate surface steadiness and grip to ensure a surefooted landing.

Runners can order a pair using standard sizing measurements. The width of this shoe is similar – it comes in the medium widths for both male and female runners. In addition, a customized and snug fit can be expected from the shoe because of its form-fitting upper, which Dynafit has combined with the Sensitive Fit+ system.","Providing the utmost durability and grip is the shoe’s outsole which is equipped with Vibram’s mapping compound. The robust system specifically uses the MegaGrip rubber in the middle of the outsole, giving the shoe that much needed traction while on the trail.","The upper of the shoe contains the most of the features that are common in Dynafit’s stable of shoes. Starting off, the form-fitting upper has been combined with the Sensitive Fit+ system to deliver medium stability to the dorsal part of the foot. Specifically, the fitted saddle found on the lateral sides of the shoe lock the mid-foot in place while allowing the forefoot to relax. Doing so lets the blood flow to the forefoot, allowing the toes to spread while the runner is propelling forward from the ground."

The most apparent change is the removal of the Flywire cables, after prototypes of the latest Streak model yielded mixed results from elite athletes. As a replacement of the Flywire cords, Nike uses an inner wrap around the midfoot to still provide that wraparound feel and security without the risks of blisters caused by too much pressure from the cords.;The elimination of the cords also directed Nike to use the tried and tested Flymesh upper variety. It has excellent breathability while giving the shoe the right blend of support, security, and accommodating fit.;Giving the Zoom Streak 6 more responsiveness is the result of a new midfoot plate. With this plate, there is much better torsional rigidity and provides a quick rebound from the compression on the midsole upon landing.;The heel section gets a slight modification with the dismissal of the thick and stitched overlay. In its place is a welded and thinner overlay to lessen the stiffness in the heel.;Finally, the outsole also offers considerable changes. The outsole is almost covered with hexagonal grooves for multi-directional traction. The new grooves enhance the grip of the shoe as opposed to the flatter outsole of the previous model.;","The fit of the Nike Zoom Streak 6 is slightly modified relative to the prior model. As the new model has a more anatomically-based last, there is more room in the forefoot for the toes to splay. The heel has excellent hold without being stiff while the midfoot remains as snug as ever. Runners with narrow to slightly wider feet should be able to get their most comfortable fit in this shoe. The sizing runs true in the latest model of the Streak.",The outsole of the Streak 6 is mostly made of different-sized hexagon-like configurations with deep flex grooves for enhanced multi-directional traction and flexibility. Nike covers the heel with hard carbon rubber for durability while the rest of the underfoot is mostly blown rubber for better grip on different surfaces.,"The upper of the Streak 6 is mostly made of Flymesh and welded overlays. Nike uses the Flymesh as it gives spot on support and flexibility to the runner. The breathability of the upper is also excellent. Giving the shoe a nice hold and security is a new inner arch strap. The more accommodating support of this design lessens the risks of blisters, particularly for those who go run hard and fast. Although the tongue is quite thin like most racers, it is made of plush material to prevent irritation. The ankle collar is adequately padded."

This structural design provides flexibility to the upper of the shoe, permitting it to expand and contract as the foot does during running.;To protect the tip of the toes, the Ballistic Bumper was added. Because this structure is tough, it lessens the impact felt by the toes when the runner accidentally bumps into objects on the trail such as rock, tree stumps, and the like.;Underfoot, runners can run confidently without worrying about early signs of wear and tear. This is all thanks to the durable Alpine Outsole by Vibram which was particularly designed for alpine running.

It features numerous flex grooves for a really flexible and smooth ride.,"The very simple upper features a really breathable mesh and FlexFilm overlays. Enveloping the entire shoe just beneath the mesh is the waterproofing feature called Gore-Tex membrane of simply GTX. While the membrane serves to seal water off the shoe, it still allows enough ventilation for the foot. At the heel portion of the shoe is the RunDry material that wicks moisture and sweat away. A moderately-padded sockliner adds cushioning and enhances the fit and comfort of the shoe."

As it is purposely-built for the mud runner, the elevated top should help keep off mud and rocks. The design should effectively work unless the user has to wade in ankle-deep mud.;Another update in the Spyridon MR Elite is the “instep brace” or what is technically a rubber strap covering the whole midfoot from the lateral to the medial side.

This serves as more reinforcement in keeping the foot in the runner’s shoe for the duration of his or her mud runs.;Lastly, the water-resistant upper is another difference in the version designed for mud runners. The water-repellent feature is for those who want to use the shoe during inclement weather. This feature also helps keep mud off of the upper.;","Vibram’s fit and sizing is quite tricky as the company has its own kind of measurement. Fans of the FiveFingers should be more familiar with how the fit goes.

Heel grip and midfoot hold are superb, so there is no chance of the shoe slipping off of the foot. It generally runs true to size.","360° of traction is ably provided by the countless lugs in the outsole of the Vibram FiveFingers Spyridon MR Elite. Vibram’s own Megagrip Compound covers the entire outsole and is responsible for the sticky grip on different types of surfaces. It measures only 5mm, which should be enough protection for barefoot mud runners. The outsole, right beneath the arch, also has a very sturdy, but flexible 3D Cocoon protection.","The upper is largely made of polyester with water-resistant features. Despite the water-resistance, it is still sufficiently breathable. The huge rubber strap around the midfoot helps keep the foot in place. This is also the function of the hook and loop cuff around the ankle. For convenient cinching, speed laces are provided by Vibram. Pull loops are located in the heel and the front to help runners with shoe entry or exit. Almost the entire section of the interior has very soft lining for a plush feel."

With this feature, the Mujin 3 GTX completely keeps off water. Keeping the shoe adequately breathable is the AirMesh that covers a large part of the upper. A system of stitched and welded overlays secures the foot from unnecessary movement and stabilizes the upper. As all the elements in the upper work together with the foot, Mizuno terms this the DynamotionFit technology. For added cushioning and better fit, an Ortholite Sockliner is used. It is also included as it has anti-microbial and moisture-wicking features."

There is also a lighter and thinner scree beneath the main mesh helps keep dirt out. The leather-like overlays and the Reebok logo give an exceptional midfoot hold. A well-cushioned sockliner is found inside for more cushioning and better support. Reebok uses a traditional lace-up closure in the 4th edition of the Pheehan Run.
